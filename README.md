# IW3MVM (2018)

A footage recording mod for Call of Duty 4.

For an overview over what this mod is for, see [https://codmvm.com/mod/iw3mvm](https://codmvm.com/mod/iw3mvm).

This repository contains the source code of the IW3MVM version released in 2018, including the IW3D exporter and IW3MAP - the IW3 map exporter released alongside IW3D.

I strongly recommend using [IWXMVM](https://github.com/reallyluckyy/IWXMVM) instead of this mod, as it is essentially a more modern version.

## Building

Both projects include a visual studio project file that should be used for the build.
The IW3MVM project includes two build configurations `STREAMS` and `IW3D`, which are used to build the normal IW3MVM version with multipass recording and the IW3D version with support for exporting 3D data.
